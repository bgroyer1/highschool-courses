# Greatest Common Factor 

## What is it?

- Direcitons may just read: *Factor Completely*
- find the greatest value that goes into each item in the trinomial
- 20a^3^ + 12a^2^ + 28a
  - factor:   

## Rules for Factoring

- Always see if there is a GCF
- consider the number of terms you have, 2 or 3 terms

### 2 Terms

- If it's two terms, such as x^2^ + 2xy + y^2^, the answer will look more like this:
  - (x + y)(x + y)
- Ask if the question has a difference of squares
- If you do, you can factor it

### 3 Terms

- If the first variable has a coefficient of 1, can factor directly
- If the leading coefficient is not 1, factor by grouping (factor out gcf, etc.)

### 4 terms

- If you have 4 terms, factor by grouping
-
