# Unit 1.1

## What is Physics?

- study of the world and universe
- deals with large objects we see, small objects we can't, light, and other forms of energy
- studies the nature of matter and energy, and their relation
- studies based on human observations, such as does the moon fall?
- derived from the Greek word physika, which means 'natural things'
- Physics is used to basically explain everything in the universe!
- Deals with transistors, time travel, string theory, laser beams, computers, warp drives, movement, energy, etc.

### Why So Much Math?!?

- Math is the language of physics
- A basic grasp of algebra is crucial to understanding physics
- Mathematics observes numeric and spacial patterns in the world around us
- Physics uses these patterns to understand the physical world around us

## Conspiracy Theories

- Conspiracy theories cannot be proven wrong, and therefore are not falsifiable. This is unscientific
- People use fear to create conspiracy theories, and those same people often make money off peoples fear
- Calling scientists liars is the basis of most conspiracy theories
- Fossil fuel lobbies actively fund conspiracy theories

## The Search For Understanding

### The Wanderers

- Ancient people used celestial bodies to define the time of year
- They noticed five bright **wanderers** followed an easter course through the constellations, but unlike stars, also moved westward for periods of time
- Babylonians associated mars with disaster
- **Romans** named it Mars after their god of war
- Early records of mars motion helped develop the concept of the solar system before the invention of the telescope
- Greek philosphers tried to determine what the earth was made up
- They originally believed it to consist of 4 elements:
  - **earth**
  - **air**
  - **water**
  - **fire**
- The existence of planets led them to believe that their was a fifth element, **quintessence**
- Writings were lost for centuries
- Found again by arabic scholars
- 12th century, writings made their way to europe, accepted as truth
- First European to claim publicly that greek books should be tested was Galileo Galilei (1564-1642

### Galileo and Scientific Methods

- 1609: Galileo Builds Telescope
- Found moon wasn't a perfect sphere, and had varied geography
- Estimated height of moons mountains based on shadows
- Discovered moons circling Jupiter
- Discovered Milky Way contains more stars
- Arugued that the earth circled the sun
- Developed the **Scientific method**
- Wrote proofs in italian, rather than latin, allowing the general public to read them

### Mars In Recent Times

- Telescopes improved, researchers found ice caps, color changes, dark areas
- People believed channels may have been formed by intelligent life
- Mars pathfinder landed on July 4, 1997
- Robot rover Sojourner explored rocks
- Scientists use mars to study what causes drastic different in climates between planets, such as why it has no atmosphere or life, despite being close to earth
- evidence of water was found in mars' ice, as well as evidence of non-ice water existing in earlier tiems

### Is Physics Important?

- Mars missions are based on physics
- Design of rockets, gyroscopic controls, precision clocks on spacecrafts require physics
- Solar panels, projection of rockets, nuclear electrical sources, cameras, computers, rradios, and receivers, all required physics

## Scientific Method

### Step 1: **Observe and Question**

- What is the best time to drive to school?
- Why do women smile more often?

### Step 2: **Research**

- Find out if other people 
have asked similar questions
- use search terms like study, research, meta analysis
- read as much as possible!
  
### Step 3: **Formulate a hypothesis**

- A theory that is **testable** to see if your idea is right or wrong

### Step 4: **Test Hypothesis**

- design a testing system to 
check the validity of your hypothesis
- make sure to account for biases

### Step 5: **Analyze and Conclude**

- Analyze the data to see if hypothesis is correct or incorrect
- Based on the findings, you may change your idea, or discover new questions

### Step 6: **Share the results**

- report/publish your results
- peer reviewed studies are important!

## 3 other useful principles

### Falsifiable

- Any scientific theory is falsifiable!
- No theory is 100% correct
- It is harder to prove the non-existence of something
- If a theory **cannot be proven wrong**, it is **not falsifiable**, and therefore not scientific

### Correlation is not causation

- Correlation is two things that are true, and may possibly be linked
- Causation is the proof of a link between two facts, b is caused by a

### Avoid Selective Windowing

- Colgate advertised that 8/10 dentists recommended their toothpaste
- However, they were simply one of many brands that dentists recommended in the survey
- colgate was sued!
