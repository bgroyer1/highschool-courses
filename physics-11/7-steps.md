# 7 Steps of a Physics Problem 

## 1. What is given?

- Given Variables
- ex:
  Given: 
  t = 6.50s
  v~i = 0 m/s
  d = 30.0 m
  a = ?

## 2. Diagram of problem

- draw a simple picture to show what the problem is

## 3. Main Equation

- which equation is being used
- ex. d = v~0t + 1/2at

## 4. Isolate the variable

- Isolate variable
- show your work

## 5. Substitute numbers and units

- input the given numbers once you've isolated the variables

## 6. Calculate final answer

- make sure answer has proper significant figures
- make sure answer proper units

## 7. Double check your units

- Run through step 5 again, but **only using the units**
