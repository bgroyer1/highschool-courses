# Significant Figures

## Precision vs Accuracy

### Precision

- **Precision** is the exactness of a measurement.
- determined by the limitation of the measuring tool
  - ruler marked in millimeters is more **precise** than a ruler marked in centimeters, etc.
- truly precise tool will have fine graduations in the scale AND allow user to repeat the measurements with the same or very similar value

### Accuracy

- **Accuracy** measures the agreement between a measurement and the "real" (or accepted standard) value
  - if a balance consistently gives a mesaurement of 3.6004g on repeated measurements, its **precision** is good.
  - however, if the actual mass is 3.7500g , then its **accuracy** is poor

### Certain digits

- Certain digit
  - Number we know for sure
- Uncertain digit
  - approximation
- Example:
  - ruler, where we guess 3.5
  - 3 is certain, .5 is a guess, in this case
  - This example has 2 significant figures
- It's better not to add extra uncertain digits. In our ruler example, 3.6 is a safe enough guess, no point adding more uncertain digits, like 3.64 cm's
