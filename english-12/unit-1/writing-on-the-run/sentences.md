# Sentence Errors

## Sentence Types

### Simple Sentence

- sentence contains a subject(person, place, or thing), and a verb (what the subject is doing)
- also called an independent clause

#### Examples

- the baby cried
  - subject: baby
  - verb: cried
- Birds fly.
  - subject: birds
  - verb: fly
- My computer
  - subject: computer
  - verb: none, **not a sentence**
- Crashed
  - subject: none, **not a sentence**
  - verb: crashed
- My computer crashed
  - subject: my computer
  - verb: crashed

#### Compound subjects and verbs

- simple sentence can have two subjects
  - ex: *Kate and I*
- can also have a subject performing two actions
  - ex: *we sang and danced*
- can have a verb phrase
  - ex: *I **will go** to the bank afterwork*
- can have two subjects and two verbs
  - ex: *Kate and I sang and danced*

### Compound Sentences

- follows the same rules as simple sentence
- contains two simple sentences with a **link** in the middle

#### Coordinate Conjunctions

- join two simple sentences together with a comma and coordinate conjunction. The coordinate conjunction shows the relationship between two sentences of equal importance
- seven coordinating conjunctions:
  - and
  - but
  - for
  - or
  - nor
  - so
  - yet
- can omit comma if subject in second clause is dropped
  - ex: *I went home after school and watched tv*

#### Semicolon

- joins two simple sentences closely related in meaning
- it is a weak period; it indicates strong relation between two sentences
- each side must stand alone as an independent clause
  - ex: *i love hockey; i hate cold hockey rinks*
  - ex: *i love hockey; cold rinks i can do without*
- letter after semicolon should not be capitalized (unless it's I, of course)

#### Conjunctive adverb

- links together two simple sentences with a semicolon
- includes:
  - accordingly
  - afterwards
  - also
  - anyway
  - besides
  - consequently
  - furthermore
  - however
  - indeed
  - in fact
  - instead
  - likewise
  - nevertheless
  - nonetheless
  - otherwise
  - similarly
  - still
  - therefore
  - thus
- here's a few exmaples
  - *I love hockey; however, i hate cold hockey rinks*
  - *I hate cold hockey rinks; nonetheless, i love hockey*
  - *I dislike cold hockey rinks; therefore, i never play hockey*
- always put a semicolon before and a comma after the verb

### Complex Sentence

- contains two simple sentences
- one is more important than the other
- the linking word (subordinate conjunction) makes the clause following it less important than the other sentence
- makes the following clause dependent upon the rest of the sentence to make sense
  - ex: don't forget your homework **when** you go to school
  - When you go to school, don't forget your homework
- main message is **don't forget your homework**
- this is the independent clause
- dependent clause is **when you go to school**
- dependent clause contains **both subject and verb, but does not make sense on its own**
- linking word can go at the beginning of a sentence, or in the middle of a sentence
- if at the beginning, **needs a comma**
  - ex: ***Because** i completed all my homework, I am going out with my friends tonight*
  - ex: *I am going out with my friends tonight **because** I completed all my homework*
- Main message is **I am going out with my friends tonight**
- dependent clause is **because i finished all my homework**
- following list of words can be used at the beginning of:
  - a dependent clause
  - a clause that lacks a subject
  - a clause that lacks a verb
  - a complete idea that cannot stand on its own
- list:
  - as
  - after
  - as long as
  - before
  - until
  - when
  - while
  - although
  - as if
  - because
  - even though
  - except that
  - if
  - since
  - though
  - unless
  - whereas
  - whether
  - why
  - where
  - wherever
- subordinate conjunctions alter meaning of a sentence
  - ex:  *Because gas heat is expensive, i will use electric*
  - ex: *If gas heat is expensive, i will use electric*
  - ex:  *Whenever gas heat is expensive, i will use electric*
  - ex:  *As long as gas heat is expensive, i will use electric*
- Relative pronouns (who, whom, whose, which, that) act as subject in the less important clause
  - ex: *i like to go to movies **that** make me laugh*

## Subject-Verb Agreement

- every sentence has both a subject and a verb
- A subject and verb should agree with one another in number and person

### Agreement in number

- singular subject should have a singular verb
- ex:
  - *Sammy **likes** to bark at squirrels*
  - sammy and likes agree because they are both singular
- ex:
  - *The birds like to taunt the cat*
  - Birds and like agree because they are both plural

### Compound Subjects Connected by *And*

- compound subject connected by **and** takes a plural verb
- ex:
  - *Suraya and Ben **spend** a lot of time at the movies*
  - Laughter and jokes often **go** hand-in-hand

### Compound Subjects Connected By **Or**

- must agree with the subject nearest to it
- ex:
  - *Coffee Beans or a tea bag **is** needed*
  - a singular verb is needed because tea bag is singular
- ex:
  - *A tea bag or coffee beans **are** needed*
  - a plural verb is needed because beans is plural

### Watch for Prepositional Phrases

- look carefully for the subject of the sentence and ensure the verb agrees before the preposition 'of'. 
- The subject is always the word before the prepositon 'of'.
- ex:
  - *The **colour** of the balloons **is** pink* 
  - Colour, the subject, is singular so the verb is singular
  - balloons is **not** the subject
- ex:
  - *The **number** of students in the class is surprising*
  - Number is the subject
  - Number is singular, so verb is singular
  - students is **not** the subject
  
### Watch for *Here* and *There*

- subject does not always come at beginning of sentence
- does not come at the beginning of sentences when here, there are used
- also does not come at the beginning with questions
- ex:
  - *There **is** a thunderstorm coming*
  - Thunderstorm is the subject, singular
  - verb is singular
- ex:
  - *There **are** many interesting **stories** in this book*
  - stories, the subject, is pluarl
  - verb is plural
- ex:
  - *Where **are** the apples i picked yesterday?*
  - apples is plural
  - so the verb, are, is also plural

### Agreement in Person

- sentences may be written in first (i, we), second (you), or third (he, she, it, they) person
- verbs often change form, depending on whether the subject is first, second, or third person
- ex:
  - *I **am** eager to get going soon*
  - *You **are** eager to get going soon*
  - *She **is** eager to get going soon*
- be sure verb form agrees with correct form of person
- watch for shifts in person when writing
  - Incorrect:
    - *When you go to the store, I am always careful to keep my wallet tucked in my pocket*

### Indefinite Pronouns

- take a singular verb
- includes:
  - none
  - anyone
  - everyone
  - no one
- ex:
  - *Everyone is present for today's meeting*
  - *No one is available for tomorrow's meeting*
- pronouns **some** and **all** may take a singular or plural verb depending upon what the pronoun is referring to
- ex:
  - ***Some** of the **puppies** in the litter **are** black*
  - ***Some** of the **food** in the fridge **is** for tomorrow's picnic*

### Collective Nouns

- nouns that represent a group but are considered singular
- includes:
  - family
  - committee
  - crowd
  - jury
  - group
  - furniture
  - garbage
- ex:
  - *The **family is** planning a vacation for next year*
  - *The **committee was** planning to make a decision next week*

## Pronoun Agreement

### What is a pronoun
