# Factoring Polynomials

## What is factoring? 

- Factoring is, essentialy, being asked to take a trinomial, and turn it into **something times something**
- List all factors of the last number of the trinomial
- Note the sign
- Figure out which of these factors both multiply to get the last value in the trinomial, and add or subtract to get the middle value in the trinomial

# Greatest Common Factor 

## What is it?

- Direcitons may just read: *Factor Completely*
- find the greatest value that goes into each item in the trinomial
- 20a^3^ + 12a^2^ + 28a
  - factor:   

## Rules for Factoring

- Always see if there is a GCF
- consider the number of terms you have, 2 or 3 terms

### 2 Terms

- If it's two terms, such as x^2^ + 2xy + y^2^, the answer will look more like this:
  - (x + y)(x + y)
- Ask if the question has a difference of squares
  - can factor a difference of squares
  - cannot factor a sum of squares
- If you do, you can factor it

### 3 Terms

- If the first variable has a coefficient of 1, can factor directly
- If the leading coefficient is not 1, factor by grouping (factor out gcf, etc.)

### 4 terms

- If you have 4 terms, factor by grouping

### Example 1

- x^2^ + 10x - 24
  - Factors of 24: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24
  - something that multiplies to negative 24 also adds to positive 10
  - (x + 12)(x - 2)
  - checking work:
  - x^2^ -2x + 12x - 24
  - This works!

---

### Example 2

- x^2^ - 10x + 24
  - Last number is positive
  - therefore, the result of the middle number must come through addition
  - factor 24: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24
  - -4 and -6 add together to -10
  - (x - 4)(x - 6)
  - checking work:
  - x^2^ -6x -4x + 24
  - This works!

---

### Example 3

- x^2^ - 11x + 28
  - Last number is positive
  - factor 28: 1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 28
  - -7 and -4 make -11
  - (x - 7)(x - 4)

---

### Example 4

- x^2^ - 13x - 48
  - Last number is negative
  - factor 48: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, 48
  - -16 and 3 make -48
  - (x - 16)(x + 3)

---

### Example 5

- x^2^ + 10x - 48
  - factor 48: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, 48
  - last number is negative
  - prime , cannot be factored

---

### Example 6

- x^2+^ + 34x - 35
  - factor: 1, 5, 7, 35
  - (x + 35)(x - 1)

---

### Example 7

- x^2^ - 13x + 30
  - factor:
    - 1, 30
    - 2, 15
    - 3, 10
    - 5, 6
  - (x - 3)(x - 10)

---

### Example 8

- x^2^ - 7x + 30
  - factor:
    - 1, 30
    - 2, 15
    - 3, 10
    - 5, 6
  - Prime, cannot be factored
 
---

### Example 9

- x^2^ - 7x - 60
  - factor:
    - 1, 60
    - 2, 30
    - 3, 20
    - 4, 15
    - 5, 12
    - 6, 10
  - (x - 12)(x + 5)

### Example 8

- x^2^ + 10x + 24
  - factor:
    - 1, 24
    - 2, 12
    - 3, 8
    - 4, 6
  - (x + 6)(x + 4)
