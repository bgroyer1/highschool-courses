# Unit 1.2

## Scientific Notation

- Shorthand way of writing numbers
- Useful for very small, or very large numbers
- all numbers are written like this:
  - a x 10^b^
- a is any real number between 1 and 10
- b is adjusted to represent the **magnitude** of the number
- if b is **positive**, we're talking about a number **greater than 10**
- if b is **negative**, we're talking about a number **less than 1**
- physicists use scientific notation for numbers:
  - greater than 10000
  - smaller than 0.001
- **Docked marks if we don't answer questions in scientific notation!**

### Large Numbers

- Example:
  - Force = G(constant) x (mass of satelilite x mass of earth / radius of the orbit to the power of 2)
  - All of these numbers are either very large, or very small
  - Scientific notation simplifies this!
  - (6.57 x 10^7^ m)
- Don't forget your unit numbers!
- Count how many spaces the decimal had to move
- Remove 0's, as long as they are not followed by a positive integer, or round to the nearest integer if allowed. This number will be between 1 and 10
- Multiply this number by ten to the power of how many spaces the decimal point moved
- 5.972 * 10^24^ kg

### Small Numbers

- Almost the same, except we count how many decimal places we had to move to the right
- The exponent will be **negative**
- 9.109 x 10^-31^

## Using a calculator

### Casio

- use the x10^x^ button
- avoid the little ^ button, more prone to mistakes
- normal number will be large, times 10 will be tiny in the middle, power will be in the top right corner
- to type 8.66 x 10^-1^
  - type 8.66, hit the x10^x^ button(-)
  - don't use the minus sign! use the negative sign!

### Sharp

- use exp button
- avoid y^x^ button
- doesn't have the x10 
- last few digits will be power
- to type 1.23x10^-99^
  - type 1.23
  - hit exp button
  - hit +/- button

### Texas Instrument

- hit EE button for exponents
- don't use y^x^ button
- to type 1.23^99^
  - 1.23
  - EE
  - 99

### Graphing Calculator

- EE button, but you have to press 2nd button first, if it is in small text above the button
- same as texas instrument from that point onwards
- to type 1.25x10^3^
  - 1.26 (2nd) (ee) 3
